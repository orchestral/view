Orchestra Platform View Component
==============

`Orchestra\View` is Orchestra Platform approach to deliver themeable application that support extensions. The functionality evolves by modifying how `Illuminate\View\ViewFileFinder` would resolve which file, which would first look into the current active theme folder, before resolving it cascading-ly.

This would allow extension (or even packages) to have it's own set of view styling while developer can maintain a standardise overall design through out the project using a theme.
